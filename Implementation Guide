# NYC Restaurant Finder - Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running and extending your NYC Restaurant Finder application.

## Running Your Application

1. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   This creates the necessary directories and files for your application.

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This starts your server on port 3000 (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

3. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the API

You can test the API directly using the test client or tools like Postman:

```bash
node test-client.js
```

## Extending the Application

### Adding More Vibes

To add more vibes, update the `vibeMapper.js` file in the `services` directory:

1. Open `services/vibeMapper.js`
2. Add a new entry to the `yelpVibeMap` object:
   ```javascript
   'family-friendly': {
     attributes: ['family_friendly'],
     categories: ['pizza', 'italian', 'mexican', 'icecream'],
     keywords: ['kids', 'family', 'child-friendly', 'casual']
   }
   ```

### Adding More Reservation Platforms

To add another reservation platform:

1. Create a new checking function in `services/reservationChecker.js`:
   ```javascript
   const checkNewPlatformAvailability = async (restaurantId, partySize, date, time) => {
     // Implementation here
   };
   ```

2. Update the `findReservationIds` function to include IDs for the new platform
3. Modify the `checkAvailability` function to call your new platform checker

### Implementing Real API Integrations

To implement real API integrations with reservation platforms:

1. Obtain API keys for the platforms (may require business partnerships)
2. Update the `.env` file with your API keys
3. Modify the reservation checking functions in `reservationChecker.js` to use the actual API endpoints and parameters

### Building a Restaurant Database

For a more comprehensive application:

1. Set up a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) to store restaurant information
2. Create a data model that maps restaurants to their IDs on different reservation platforms
3. Update the `findReservationIds` function to query this database instead of using hardcoded values
4. Create admin tools for managing the restaurant database

### Enhancing the User Interface

To improve the user experience:

1. Add more filters (neighborhood, specific features, etc.)
2. Implement user accounts for saving preferences and favorite restaurants
3. Add a map view showing restaurant locations
4. Create a mobile-responsive design for better experience on phones
5. Add restaurant photos, menus, and reviews

### Handling Real-Time Reservation Data

For real-time reservation availability:

1. Implement caching to reduce API calls to reservation platforms
2. Add webhook support to receive updates when reservation status changes
3. Create a notification system to alert users when a desired reservation becomes available

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. **Security**:
   - Use HTTPS for all requests
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
   - Store API keys securely using environment variables

2. **Scalability**:
   - Consider containerizing with Docker
   - Set up load balancing for handling multiple users
   - Implement caching to reduce external API calls

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add logging for debugging and analytics
   - Set up error reporting
   - Monitor API usage and response times

## Monetization Options

Potential ways to monetize this service:

1. Premium subscription model for unlimited searches
2. Commission on successful bookings
3. Featured restaurant listings
4. Restaurant partnership program
5. White-label solution for hotels and concierge services
